# How to install ! CAPS-11 on SIMH?

![SIMH PDP-11 emulator with ! CAPS-11](./caps-11-SIMH-3.webp)

We can run [! CAPS-11](/1970s/1970/caps-11) on the SIMH PDP-11 emulator. First, we need to download the ! CAPS-11 kit.

## Downloads

You can download the kit needed to run ! CAPS-11 on the SIMH PDP-11 emulator from the [“SIMH Legacy” website](http://simh.trailing-edge.com/):

- [! CAPS-11 kit](http://simh.trailing-edge.com/kits/caps11_system.zip)

## Using ! CAPS-11

:::tip

If you have not already installed SIMH PDP-11 emulator, see [the VirtualHub Setup tutorial on how to do so](https://setup.virtualhub.eu.org/simh-pdp11/) on Linux and Windows.

:::

Extract the kit you downloaded. Inside you will find two files. Create a folder somewhere to store the files for this VM, and move the file named `caps11.t60` into it.

Now we will create a config file for our VM. Create a text file called `pdp11.ini` with the following content in the VM folder:

```ini
set cpu 11/05
set throttle 5%
set cpu 32k
set ptr disabled
set ptp disabled
set lpt disabled
set dz disabled
set rk disabled
set rl disabled
set hk disabled
set rx disabled
set rp disabled
set rq disabled
set tm disabled
set tq disabled
set ta enabled
att ta0 caps11.t60

```

![pdp11.ini](./caps-11-SIMH-1.webp)

Now open a terminal and move to the VM folder. Run the following command to start the emulator:

```bash
pdp11
```

![pdp11](./caps-11-SIMH-2.webp)

After the emulator starts, you can type `dir` followed by enter. It will list all the files available on the disk.

That's it! We used ! CAPS-11. We can create a shell script to make it easy to launch the VM.

### Linux

Create a file called `caps-11.sh` with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pdp11
```

Now make the file executable:

```bash
chmod +x caps-11.sh
```

Now you can start the VM using the shell script. For example, on KDE you can right-click the file and choose `Run in Konsole` or on GNOME, where you can right-click the file and choose `Run as executable`. The VM will start.

See the [manuals section](/1970s/1970/caps-11/#manuals) on the [main ! CAPS-11 page](/1970s/1970/caps-11) to learn how to use it.

### Windows

Create a file called `caps-11.bat` with the following content:

```bash
pdp11
```

Now you can start the VM by double-clicking the shell script. See the [manuals section](/1970s/1970/caps-11/#manuals) on the [main ! CAPS-11 page](/1970s/1970/caps-11) to learn how to use it.
