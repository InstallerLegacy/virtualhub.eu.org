In the last few days, we have installed and configured Kubuntu. If you have not seen the tutorials yet, here are the links:

Now we will start installing old operating systems. Starting from 1981, I have created a list of OS and software I will install which were released in that year. For year 1981, here is the list:

I plan to complete all these tutorials by the end of November, but it may take more time. So, the first tutorial on [VirtualHub](https://virtualhub.eu.org) will be on how to install 86-DOS on the Altair-Z80 emulator, but first there will be a tutorial on [VirtualHub Setup](https://setup.virtualhub.eu.org) on how to install Altair-Z80 on Kubuntu and other Linux distributions.

Stay tuned!
