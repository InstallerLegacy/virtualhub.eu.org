Welcome to the VirtualHub Blog. This blog has been created to record my continued struggle for finding a perfect CMS/SSG for the VirtualHub website.<!-- truncate --> Until now, I have used WordPress, CloudCanon, and Publii. None of them proved to be the tool I have dreamed of.

:::note

This version of VirtualHub is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This blog post is old and may contain wrong info.

:::

Now I am trying Jekyll. This blog is generated using it. Stay tuned, and you can access an early insight into the VirtualHub website powered by Jekyll.

I will continue posting different stories about what I am planning to do with the VirtualHub and Legacy Installer sites and other projects that I think of.

Stay tuned!
